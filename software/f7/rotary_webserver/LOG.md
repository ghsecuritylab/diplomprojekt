## 21.5.19
### entry 1
i started importing the pins that hkorinek used into the webserver project, but i haven't got enough time left, so i'll finish it thursday
## 23.5.19
### entry 3
so, i'd have to reimplement everything i had up to this point again because cubemx deosn't like my code... so i'll try not using it and copying the code form hkorineks files by hand.
### entry 4
i copied everything, it compiles and the old code still seems to function properly. can't test it though, as hkorinek is not in today. i'ill work on improving the uart interface for the rest of the day. dont forget to finish implementing 'help'.
